<h1>Homework 7:Illustrated Environment</h1>
<img src="mountains.png" width="400px">
<img src="originalmountains.jpg" width="400px">
<p>For this illustrated image,I decided to use an image from the unsplash of mountains instead of houses or buildings. I used the color purple for the background, I also used the color green, made a part light green and dark towards the middle kind of like a passage and put the color black on the mountains.</p>
