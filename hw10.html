<h1>Homework 10: Interactive Story</h1>
<img src="artboard.jpg" width="400px">
<p>For this image, I used Adobe Photoshop and generated each image. For this story I wanted to show a college student studying in a quiet hallway in the 5th of Hunter College. In that she goes through struggles, listens to music, non stop studying until she gets sleepy, distracted by her phone and manages to fall completely asleep.</p>
