<h1>Homework 3: Depth of Field</h1>
<h3>Part 1</h3>
<img src="metal.jpg" width="400px">
<p>For this image, it was only focused and not blured so I just added blur four or five times to the background like near the door, two in the right corner and one on the left. I also played around with the brightness and colors like green and black to make it like like the original.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Part 2</h3>
<img src="garbage.jpg" width="400px">
<img src="pole.jpg" width="400px">
<p>For the first image, I really liked how the camera focused on the garbage, showing the reflection of the light, the green and white sticker, and sticky marks. This image gave off a vintage look which is why I chose it. I played around with the brightness and the opacity to really make the garbage stand out.</p>
<p>For the second image, I really liked the how the stair case sits, it gave a mysterious and an abanded vibe because it was originally dark, and had shadows around the stairs. So I brightned the image, when I did the image looked blury, almost foggy, as if it was taken on a bad quality camera. This image gave me hosiptal vibes after editing it.</p>
