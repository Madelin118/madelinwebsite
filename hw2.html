<p>I chose these two images because they both have an old feeling and interesting details that really captured my eyes. In the first image, I was just drawn to the tone of the metal chain, the tiny handwritten note and this red heart shaped logo. I liked how the lighting and shadows made the note and chain stand out against the darker background, giving off a quiet, mysterious, vintage vibe.</p>
<p>For the second image, I wanted to show the shapes, textures, and design of the inside of the piano. By turning it black and white, the patterns of the strings and the smooth metal stick out more, and the lack of color helped focus on the structure of the strings. Also cropping the image made the lines look like it was moving. Both of these images use light, texture, and composition to make any objects feel more special and worth looking at closely.</p>
