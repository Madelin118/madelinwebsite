<h1>Homework 6: Vector Emotive Eye</h1>
<img src="eye.ai" width="400px">
<p>For this eye image, I was going for a more siren eye. I also added cat shaped eyes but I gave it two eyes, one going straight while the other goes vertical with a small circle in the middle. The sharpness and especially the eyes it’s like it’s watching you, focused, intense, maybe smart, and strong. With the complementary colors orange and blue gave it a football vibe and funny looking eye brow shaped gives you an angry or confident.</p>
