<h1>Homework 9: Data Visulization</h1>
<img src="tiktokgraph.png" width="400px">
<p>For this graph image, since TikTok is quite popluar, I decided to create a google form asking if students have TikTok, about 10 people said yes and 6 people said no. I also used a pie graph for this one using the light color of purple for those that said no and dark purple for those that said yes. I made the title shorter, also added a bigger white circle outside the pie graph, added the percentage 40% for no and 60% for yes in the pie graph. For the column graph, I used toned brown colors and for this on it shows the number of people and hours they spend on TikTok. 7 people spend 0 hours on TikTok, 1 person spent an hour, 5 people spent 2 hours, and 3 people spent 3 hours on TikTok. Using a mid dark brown as the background and smaller white rectangle with the graph in the middle. For the last one, I really liked the arrow graph I found in google, and all I did was use a square tool and the curve tool to turn it into a triangle while also making a longer rectangle and just grouped it together.  This section was mainly to show what types of categories people get on their fyp, like 4 people shoes, food, 3 people chose fashion, 2 people chose music, 2 people chose anime, one person chose digital art, one person chose memes and one person chose all of the above.</p>
