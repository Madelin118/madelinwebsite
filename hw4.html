<h1>Homework 4: Photomontage </h1>
<h3>Part 1</h3>
<img src="war.jpg" width="400px">
<i><p>For the first image, I remember watching this anime called “Grave of the fire flies”, these two children reminded me of Setsuko and Seita. You can see how the older brother is carrying his deceased younger sibling, standing barefoot, biting his lip, waiting for his little brother to get cremated. The photo of these two children was taken after the atomic bomb, and in this case I wanted to show the impact of war, basically how war robbed these two children of their childhood.</p>
<p>In this image, it was already white and black, I added three textures, glass blue colored, a green film like texture, and old film that has faded black parts with this old paper color in between texture to give it this foggy, faded, old look, I also liked when after layering these three textures, it created these marks or patches that look like the image lost some color. I also played around with the blending mode, clicking on the screen, soft light, lighter color, because it toned down the image making these two children stand out. Also adding the text image “The End” to basically put an end to the war and stop the suffering, like for example like the bombs that occurred in Gaza, destroying many people’s homes, and multiple deaths.</p></i>

<h3>Part 2</h3>
<img src="survival.jpg" width="400px">
<i><p>For the second image, I’ve realized how much money is needed in this life. I found an image on pexels of coins instead of cash because I wanted this vintage aesthetic. I selected text images like "homeless", “food”, "Hungry" and “work” from cardboard posters I found on pexels, to show failures of inequality, poverty and struggle to survive. Putting all of those words along with the coins, really shows how much it goes with it.</p>
<p>In the image, I added a paper texture almost like a newspaper but old paper and used multiply blend mode, to give the coin image this cash, paper texture that it did not have. I also cut the text images unevenly because I wanted to show how serious and desperate the situation is. The word “homeless” I added to show those who are in a bad situation and used the blended mode called screen because I liked how it faded a little allowing the coin to show. The word “work” was to show opportunity, so I used linear light for the blending mode because it gave it a bit of brightness but a bit of dark in it to show the ups and downs. The word “food” and “hungry” I used the blended modes like hard light and soft light to make it different from the other text images.</p></i>
