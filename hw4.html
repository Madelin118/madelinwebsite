<h1>Homework 4: Design Basics</h1>
<h3>Part 1</h3>
<img src="war.jpg" width="400px">
<i><p>For the first image, I remember watching this anime called “Grave of the fire flies”, these two children reminded me of Setsuko and Seita. You can see how the older brother is carrying his deceased younger sibling, standing barefoot, biting his lip, waiting for his little brother to get cremated. The photo of these two children was taken after the atomic bomb, and in this case I wanted to show the impact of war, basically how war robbed these two children of their childhood.</p>
<p>In this image, it was already white and black, I added three textures, glass blue colored, a green film like texture, and old film that has faded black parts with this old paper color in between texture to give it this foggy, faded, old look, I also liked when after layering these three textures, it created these marks or patches that look like the image lost some color. I also played around with the blending mode, clicking on the screen, soft light, lighter color, because it toned down the image making these two children stand out. Also adding the text image “The End” to basically put an end to the war and stop the suffering, like for example like the bombs that occurred in Gaza, destroying many people’s homes, and multiple deaths.</p></i>
