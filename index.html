<h1>Madelin's Portfolio</h1>
<img src="images/me.jpg" width="400px">
<p>Hi!! I’m Madelin Fernandez, I am 20. I’m a student interested in studying media studies. I like to draw specifically anime, but hope to grow as an artist and draw more realistic drawings. I’ve always been interested in anything creatively, hands on, analyzing references. Lately, I’ve been drawing more and was able to build my old drawing account on instagram back up. Other than that, I hope to study anatomy, more realism works while still drawing anime art.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time watching anime, reading mangas or manhwa, and recently I’ve been watching a lot of rom coms movies. I think I’m drawn to that feeling, the emotion of stories or character development that really makes me want to learn more about it. Also I’d love the idea of combining my interests in media studies and art, maybe animation, character design, etc. As of right now I’m focused on growing, learning new techniques, and finding my style.
</p>
