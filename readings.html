<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave</i></h3>
<p>To capture photography and images to me is really more than just capturing what’s out there, rather it holds memories for me to remember parts of my life, especially when I was little,n I graduated my schools, and especially people who I can not see anymore. In the opening chapter of On Photography by Susan Sontag, she points out how the camera changes the way we experience life. How people were already taking pictures all the time like, even before smartphones existed people would paint, draw, create sculptures. She also talks about how our experiences in our photographs feel more real or like a bond. But rather than seeing my own pictures I take on the phone, I would love to see how others would review it.</p>
<p>When I’m taking a picture on my phone, I’m always thinking what a beautiful moment was captured within a single photo, it's not always beautiful but silly, crazy, just all over the place. However, these pictures are like telling a part of my life. For example, if you just take a picture of a crowded place like a group of people on the train, you can capture the energy they give off, different cultures may be the same, the point is that you get a certain feeling of being in that space. Which sort of places a role into how emotions can be conveyed in illustrations, drawings, graphics, etc. What’s more interesting is how reading a book with images and words can help people picture or think about the things they can’t see on their own.</p>
<p>These days, there are lots of images out there that have been really shaping the way we understand certain events or issues in society. For example, a photo of a protest of some sort or even something involving disasters or maybe violence among people or nature can be known within seconds, creating opinions and even lead to policy. Which shows how big of an impact the news, social media have on people. We also have images that are the center of attention. With that said, when I start to make my own, I want to think deeper on how to use the images carefully. I want photos that have a meaning, that causes people to have thoughts and create conversations. Like having a way to get people to ask questions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I feel like the best example to show how our world is right now through photography or illustrations would have to be the beauty and struggle of it. For example, I could photograph the life of a college student then add drawings or texts to show the stress behind being a college student. Or I could mix images of how transportation is, to show the truth and life beyond a student life. Putting all these ideas together can really help show the imperfect world of today. I want to make work that doesn’t only show the world but shows people to look at it differently.</p>

<h3>Reading Response #002: <i>AI Slop</i></h3>
<p>After reading Nesrine Malik’s article, I feel like she is telling us how AI is changing the way we see and believe things. She calls it “AI slop” such as fake, computer made images or videos that are appearing everywhere, only making it harder to tell what’s actually real. Also Malik states how little by little we start to lose trust in what we see. Because most AI looks realistic enough to fool most people into believing false information and may not even realize it. Which leaves you to forget how to tell what’s real and what’s fake.</p>
<p>Malik goes on to say how there are two worlds; one where you see real images and the other filled with AI. The real world shows things such as news, documentaries and true events, while the AI world is made up of images that just look pretty or emotional that really aren't true. Most fake images are not always harmless. Malik goes on to say how they can hide political messages or stereotypes, only making AI more dangerous. Also AI can spread certain ideas or beliefs without people noticing it. Even though certain AI images can be entertaining, most share it without a second thought, which only helps spread false or biased messages faster.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Malik also talks about how these fake images go on private chats, like WhatsApp or Facebook. When AI generated pictures are shared with family or friends, most would believe them because someone who they trust sended it to them. For example, when Malik kept getting generated pictures of Sudan’s war from her elderly relative, thinking the picture was real. This only shows how easily false images can spread from one person to the other, without checking if it's actually real before showing or sending it. In this case technology isn’t the problem but actually how we people use and trust it.</p>
<p>Something Malik also points out is how AI images often only show one kind of world. Since AI learns from data that’s already existing, it repeats patterns and biases. For example, when you generate certain pictures, it either turns people into white people or it mostly shows white people, which is how gender roles used to be or standards before. Which shows AI can only make similar images, leaving out other races, cultures, basically only showing one part of reality then it being more diverse.</p>
<p>To conclude, Malik indicates how we are “sleepwalking”, not realizing the real dangers of how much change is happening. 	It’s like the world is getting used to what’s fake that now it's mixing with the real. I feel like Malik messages are a wake up call where we need to be more careful, ask questions, and learn how to tell apart what’s real or fake content. Being able to tell whether something is AI or real is a good thing but if people can’t tell the difference, then the world will just be filled with things that are no longer true.</p>

<h3>Reading Response #003: <i>Graphic Novel: Motherhood in Crisis</i></h3>
<p>In the story, Heela: The Schoolgirl – My Stolen Future from Motherhood in Crisis by Laurence Ivil, Alicia Prager, and Saidu Bah, illustration shows Heela’s story in a deep and emotional way. Heela is young but her life changes when she becomes a mother too early. The illustrations help tell her story because it shows what she was feeling, whether she has fears, or is sad in ways that photos or text can't really show. Using illustrations showed how personal and emotional can make anybody feel.</p>
<p>The illustrations look different from the photographs because there's more emotions than just facts. Things like photos can show what a person looks like, but with an illustration you can feel what the person may have went through. For example, in Heela’s story, the drawings mostly uses this soft or dark colors to show sadness or maybe a feeling of loss. Also most of the time the background can be simple or plain, but in this case it makes Heela look rather small or alone. Which helps show how she may have felt trapped and powerless, as she feels that her future was taken away. Also even the art style helps us focus on her emotions, not just what's around her.</p>
<p>Also, illustration is significant because it's more safe and respectful, especially to Heela. In most places, it's not always the best to show photos of girls in situations that can even be dangerous or shameful in other people's eyes. With Illustration, it allowed her story to be told without having to show her face or her name. While it protects her privacy, it also tells others her message. The drawings can also speak or even give hope for other girls who went through the same situation and are scared to speak up. Also it's important to have a community that can help others, like people who helped Heela. As it helps others, this makes Heela’s story even more diverse and shows that this problem not only affects Heela, but others too.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the advantage of illustrations is how it helps show Heela’s emotions. For example, the words tell what may have happened, but the drawings show more like memories, and imagination. Another example can be, how one image can show Heela as a student, maybe going to class, studying, hanging out with her friends, thinking about her future job, or college overall having big dreams while also being a young mother holding her baby. This shows us how one can have hope and loss at the same time. Additionally, it's not just about what happened to her, but how it changed her whole life.</p>
<p>To conclude, the use of illustration in Heela: The Schoolgirl – My Stolen Future, although it's a short story, you can sympathize with it. Having things like texts, photos, and drawings, becomes more impactful and more emotional. Also helps see both her situation and the feelings behind it. Therefore, illustrations make us stop, think, and feel empathy for Heela and others just like her.</p>

<h3>Reading Response #004: <i>The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It</i></h3>
<p>After reading The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It, people don’t realize how dangerous the nuclear war would be if it occurred during this time. The article jumps straight on how the dangers of nuclear war are real and only getting worse. Also many countries have nuclear weapons and knowing how advanced things have gotten, like technology, only makes the nowadays weapons far more dangerous than weapons from the early 1900s. You’d think that a small nuclear bomb wouldn’t cause much destruction because of its size but it indeed does when compared to the ones used in World War ll. Knowing that is scary, especially how easily an explosion could destroy a city and even harm innocent lives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the article discusses why the risk is only rising. It’s already known that many countries have nuclear weapons and there is always this rivalry, political arguments, problems with most countries kind of like Russia and America once upon a time. Also how Israel kept bombing Gaza, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Lebanon, destroying multiple cities, taking many lives, all for their personal benefits. These countries are quick to use nuclear weapons as soon as they see fit, it can be something as simple as they don’t like each other and release these weapons without realizing the harm it's causing to its people. There indeed are rules, treaties and agreements to having nuclear weapons but countries don’t seem to care anymore.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that nuclear weapons are used for wars, there are better ways to avoid nuclear wars. The article talks about how countries can communicate with one another, be more clear in terms of information, although having some form of treaty isn’t enough there can be new ones made that limit how many nuclear weapons countries should have. Like most counties, they act out of emotions  and they could at any moment release these bombs, which is better to create some sort of system where they can sort it out. So it's better to avoid disaster at all causes and actually cooperate together with honesty.</p>
<p>When nuclear bombs are thrown at countries, cities, the environment in general, it's really not talked about enough how much it affects our society. In the article, it often uses these moving images when you scroll to read, it shows the gases, the destruction, the burns when a bomb explodes, even where it occurs and just spreads. Most don’t really think about nuclear weapons simply because they are far away from them or are occurring in a different country. However worse case scenario things go wrong, it most definitely affects everyone. Overall it is just important to be aware and understand that this is a problem because most countries have nuclear bombs and can do anything with them.</p>
<p>To conclude, the article The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It, is mostly warning us about how dangerous and powerful nuclear weapons can be and also how we reduce the risk of the dangers of these weapons.</p>
