<h1>Reading Responses</h1>
<h3>Reading Response #001: <i>In Plato's Cave</i></h3>
<p>To capture photography and images to me is really more than just capturing what’s out there, rather it holds memories for me to remember parts of my life, especially when I was little,n I graduated my schools, and especially people who I can not see anymore. In the opening chapter of On Photography by Susan Sontag, she points out how the camera changes the way we experience life. How people were already taking pictures all the time like, even before smartphones existed people would paint, draw, create sculptures. She also talks about how our experiences in our photographs feel more real or like a bond. But rather than seeing my own pictures I take on the phone, I would love to see how others would review it.</p>
<p>When I’m taking a picture on my phone, I’m always thinking what a beautiful moment was captured within a single photo, it's not always beautiful but silly, crazy, just all over the place. However, these pictures are like telling a part of my life. For example, if you just take a picture of a crowded place like a group of people on the train, you can capture the energy they give off, different cultures may be the same, the point is that you get a certain feeling of being in that space. Which sort of places a role into how emotions can be conveyed in illustrations, drawings, graphics, etc. What’s more interesting is how reading a book with images and words can help people picture or think about the things they can’t see on their own.</p>
<p>These days, there are lots of images out there that have been really shaping the way we understand certain events or issues in society. For example, a photo of a protest of some sort or even something involving disasters or maybe violence among people or nature can be known within seconds, creating opinions and even lead to policy. Which shows how big of an impact the news, social media have on people. We also have images that are the center of attention. With that said, when I start to make my own, I want to think deeper on how to use the images carefully. I want photos that have a meaning, that causes people to have thoughts and create conversations. Like having a way to get people to ask questions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I feel like the best example to show how our world is right now through photography or illustrations would have to be the beauty and struggle of it. For example, I could photograph the life of a college student then add drawings or texts to show the stress behind being a college student. Or I could mix images of how transportation is, to show the truth and life beyond a student life. Putting all these ideas together can really help show the imperfect world of today. I want to make work that doesn’t only show the world but shows people to look at it differently.</p>

<h3>Reading Response #002: <i>AI Slop</i></h3>
<p>After reading Nesrine Malik’s article, I feel like she is telling us how AI is changing the way we see and believe things. She calls it “AI slop” such as fake, computer made images or videos that are appearing everywhere, only making it harder to tell what’s actually real. Also Malik states how little by little we start to lose trust in what we see. Because most AI looks realistic enough to fool most people into believing false information and may not even realize it. Which leaves you to forget how to tell what’s real and what’s fake.</p>
<p>Malik goes on to say how there are two worlds; one where you see real images and the other filled with AI. The real world shows things such as news, documentaries and true events, while the AI world is made up of images that just look pretty or emotional that really aren't true. Most fake images are not always harmless. Malik goes on to say how they can hide political messages or stereotypes, only making AI more dangerous. Also AI can spread certain ideas or beliefs without people noticing it. Even though certain AI images can be entertaining, most share it without a second thought, which only helps spread false or biased messages faster.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Malik also talks about how these fake images go on private chats, like WhatsApp or Facebook. When AI generated pictures are shared with family or friends, most would believe them because someone who they trust sended it to them. For example, when Malik kept getting generated pictures of Sudan’s war from her elderly relative, thinking the picture was real. This only shows how easily false images can spread from one person to the other, without checking if it's actually real before showing or sending it. In this case technology isn’t the problem but actually how we people use and trust it.</p>
<p>Something Malik also points out is how AI images often only show one kind of world. Since AI learns from data that’s already existing, it repeats patterns and biases. For example, when you generate certain pictures, it either turns people into white people or it mostly shows white people, which is how gender roles used to be or standards before. Which shows AI can only make similar images, leaving out other races, cultures, basically only showing one part of reality then it being more diverse.</p>
<p>To conclude, Malik indicates how we are “sleepwalking”, not realizing the real dangers of how much change is happening. 	It’s like the world is getting used to what’s fake that now it's mixing with the real. I feel like Malik messages are a wake up call where we need to be more careful, ask questions, and learn how to tell apart what’s real or fake content. Being able to tell whether something is AI or real is a good thing but if people can’t tell the difference, then the world will just be filled with things that are no longer true.</p>
