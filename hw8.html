<h1>Homework 8: Animation </h1>
<h3>GIF 1</h3>
<img src="movingeye.gif" width="400px">
<p>For my animated eye, I was inpried by Doraemon, a character from a manga and animated series called Dorarmon. I really liked his big round eyes and wanted to try drawing it as my first animation. So for each frame I just kept drawing the eye going down and down until closed and same thing with adding two eyelashes.</p>

<h3>GIF 2</h3>

<p>For the second GIF, I found these Michael Jackson photos on Pinterest and I thought It was very fun, funky with his funny looking expressions. I followed the steps on how to make a series of photos animation and for each photo layer I wanted to make the background red to make him pop out and outline with black kind of like a frame but messy.</p>
