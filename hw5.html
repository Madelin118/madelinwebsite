<h1>Homework 5: Photomontage & Design</h1>

<p>For the first collage, I decided to go for a social role and immediately thought of Britney Spears. Britney Spears has had a huge impact on society with her music such as pop, her image, career, public life however with the media pressure, mental health or fame, it really affected her. And I wanted to show all of her.In the image, I used a broken glass texture underneath the other images to show how broken she felt inside. I also put the hard light blending mode to give it a glossy, early-2000s magazine aesthetic, echoing the era of her fame. I chose three images from Pinterest where Britney blows a bubblegum from her early songs like “Oops!... I Did It Again” and “...Baby One More Time” to show her playful, pop-star side. I added a black-and-white photo of her in a car and placed only bubblegum in the middle of the other bubblegums. I also used parts of other photos like just her hand from where she wears a pink wig and makes a phone call, the moment when she shaved her head at the top, and a recent photo of her in the corner. I also added three houses I created on Illustrator and put it on top of her right eye, one below her hand on the left and one I rotated pointing out on the left of her bald head. I wanted to show how much she needed help, how broken she was while also showing how edgy and iconic she was.</p>
