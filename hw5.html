<h1>Homework 5: Collages</h1>
<h3>Part 1</h3>
<img src="britney.jpg" width="400px">
<i><p>For the first collage, I decided to go for a social role and immediately thought of Britney Spears. Britney Spears has had a huge impact on society with her music such as pop, her image, career, public life however with the media pressure, mental health or fame, it really affected her. And I wanted to show all of her.</p>
<p>In the image, I used a broken glass texture underneath the other images to show how broken she felt inside. I also put the hard light blending mode to give it a glossy, early 2000s magazine aesthetic, echoing the era of her fame. I chose three images from Pinterest where Britney blows a bubblegum from her early songs like “Oops!... I Did It Again” and “...Baby One More Time” to show her playful, pop-star side. I added a black-and-white photo of her in a car and placed only bubblegum in the middle of the other bubblegums. I also used parts of other photos like just her hand from where she wears a pink wig and makes a phone call, the moment when she shaved her head at the top, and a recent photo of her in the corner. I purposely colored the cut out images red using the brush tool to make the her stand out.</p></i>

<h3>Part 2</h3>
<img src="city.jpg" width="400px">
<p>For my second collage, I went for a social collage graphic design, showing an iconic phrase in New York “The City That Never Sleeps” but instead I altered it to “The City that zzzzz I <3 Sleep” purposely layering it over a photo of New York City. I also wanted to make it humorous, changing it to “I love to sleep” that shows modern moods, like urban lifestyle which relates to social themes. I also added a texture that looks like a film tape and kept it in normal blending mode. While also adding letters of all kinds of shapes to give the collage more meaning.</p>
